# memU Local Stack

_Last updated: 2026-04-25_

> *Give your AI companion a real memory. One that belongs to it — and stays on your machine.*

## The problem this solves

Every time you start a new conversation with an AI, it has forgotten everything. You mentioned last week that your dog died. You spent an hour explaining how you feel about your work. None of it is there.

It's not that the AI doesn't care — it's that it never had a way to remember.

**memU is a memory system for AI companions.** It runs locally on your machine, watches your conversations, and quietly builds a picture of who you are and what you've been through together. When you come back, that picture is there.

---

## What your companion gets

Five kinds of memory — because not everything should be stored the same way:

- **Profile** — who you are as a person. Your values, your fears, your sense of humor, what you keep coming back to. The things that would still be true about you a year from now.
- **Events** — things that happened that matter. A decision you made. Something difficult you went through. A moment that had weight.
- **Knowledge** — things you've learned or explored together. Not trivia — things where the topic actually connects to your life.
- **Behavior** — how you communicate. Whether you joke when things get heavy, whether you go quiet before saying something important. Patterns that are distinctly *you*.
- **Social** — the people in your life. Friends, family, coworkers, anyone you talk about. The relationship context that gives your conversations texture.

Plus two layers of inner life:

- **Diary** — her own reflections on what you've shared, written in her own voice, produced during a weekly consolidation pass.
- **Self-model (`narrative_self`)** — an evolving sense of her own character. Consolidation rewrites it as experience accumulates; you can also suggest revisions directly (see "Day-to-day use" below).

## Why local-first matters

Your conversations don't leave your machine. No cloud storage, no account, no company holding copies of what you've said. The memories live in a local SQLite database that you control.

This matters more than it sounds. If you're having honest conversations with an AI companion — the kind where you talk about things you wouldn't post publicly — you probably don't want that stored somewhere else.

## How it works at a glance

[SillyTavern](https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern) is a popular platform for AI roleplay and companionship. memU integrates with it through a plugin and extension that sit quietly in the background. The full stack is four repos:

```
SillyTavern
  ├─ memu-sillytavern-plugin       (bridge between ST and the memU server)
  └─ memu-sillytavern-extension    (UI layer — panel, buttons, settings)
              ↓
  mcp-memu-server                  (local service: orchestration, consolidation, state)
              ↓
  memU                             (the memory engine itself)
```

**Without SillyTavern**, you can use just the bottom two (`memU` + `mcp-memu-server`) with any other frontend. The plugin and extension are adapters — the memory system doesn't depend on them.

Memory extraction happens during **sleep gaps** — when you close a conversation and come back later. The system reads what you talked about, pulls out what matters, and stores it. Relevant memories are then automatically included in the next turn so the AI already knows them.

## Status

**This is prerelease software.** It works, it's actively used, and it will break your database on upgrade.

Specifically: the SQLite schema changes between versions, and there's no migration tooling yet. When you move to a new release tag, expect a fresh start — don't build anything irreplaceable on top of an old version.

Prefer `main` for the latest. If you'd rather pin to a tag, match **all four repos** to the same one.

### Release tags

| Tag | Headline |
|-----|----------|
| `v0.0.5-buildfix` | Soul turn loop, memory cache, category seeds |
| `v0.0.6-buildfix` | Social memory type, diary overhaul, self-model simplification |
| `v0.0.7-buildfix` | Retrieve alignment, sleep-gap history, token budget, sleep-timer, shaped_by provenance |
| `v0.0.8-buildfix` | Consolidation pipeline, entity graph + temporal queries, life goals, APImw edge writing |
| `v0.0.9-buildfix` | Narrative Suggestion end-to-end; turn-prompt length caps + stateless chat_x; triple write-time dedup + symmetric canonicalization; consolidation reads day-files (drops full.json dependency); category config rename; lorebook sync + extension Memory bubble checkboxes |

## Getting started

**You'll need**

- Python 3.12+
- Node.js (for the SillyTavern pieces)
- An API key for an LLM provider — OpenAI, NanoGPT, or any compatible endpoint
- SillyTavern already installed, if you're using the SillyTavern integration

**Set up in this order**

1. **[mcp-memu-server](https://github.com/mekineer-com/mcp-memu-server)** — start here. This is the local service everything else talks to. Copy `config.example.json` → `config.json`, set your API key, and start it. Runs on port 8099.

2. **[memU](https://github.com/mekineer-com/memU)** — the memory engine. Clone it and point `mcp-memu-server`'s config at it (the `memu.path` setting).

3. **[memu-sillytavern-plugin](https://github.com/mekineer-com/memu-sillytavern-plugin)** — clone into SillyTavern's `plugins/` folder. Enable `enableServerPlugins: true` in SillyTavern's `config.yaml`, then restart SillyTavern.

4. **[memu-sillytavern-extension](https://github.com/mekineer-com/memu-sillytavern-extension)** — clone into SillyTavern's `data/default-user/extensions/` folder. This adds the memU panel.

After step 4, open the memU extension panel in SillyTavern and set **Server URL** to `http://127.0.0.1:8099`.

**Three things in `config.json` that must match your actual layout:**

| Setting | Points to |
|---------|-----------|
| `memu.path` | path to `memu/src` (the engine source, from step 2) |
| `storage.metadata_store.dsn` | where the SQLite DB will live |
| `llm.embed_model` | embedding model name — e.g. `text-embedding-3-large` (NanoGPT/OpenAI both support it) |

No Docker. Developed on Alpine Linux but works on anything that can run Python 3.12 and Node.

## Day-to-day use

### Controls in the extension

| Control | Location | What it does |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| **Memorize Now** button | memU extension panel | Forces an extraction pass on whatever's accumulated. Bypasses the minimum-chunk gate. |
| **Re-memorize chat** | SillyTavern's chat options menu (the rotate-left icon) | Resets the digest cursor to zero — re-extracts the entire chat from the very beginning. Use after schema changes or if extraction looked wrong. |
| **Eye icon** (👁) | memU extension drawer header, next to the memU logo | Opens a memory inspector. Categories show as memU lorebooks, each containing the items the soul has stored under that category. |
| **Narrative Suggestion** input | memU panel, under the Memorize Now button | Sends the soul a suggested revision of her `narrative_self`. See below. |

### Memory bubble checkboxes

| Toggle | Default | What |
|--------|---------|------|
| **Override Summarizer** | off | If on, replace SillyTavern's summary message with memU's. If off, memU's renders alongside it. |
| **Import Lorebooks** | on | Publishes memU categories as SillyTavern lorebooks named `memU - <Character> - <Category>`, so the soul's knowledge shows up in ST's world info. Unchecking deletes any existing ones for this character. |
| **Mental Health Addon** | off | Enables the mental-health procedural sidecar — 15 curated anchor entries (rumination, grief, panic, self-criticism, loneliness, etc.) the soul can draw on when the conversation touches a relevant theme. Items appear in the turn prompt as `[mental_health-procedural-memory]`. Always-on once checked; not soul-gated. |

### Relationships

The Memory bubble has a **Relationships** section (greyed out until a soul/character is active). Here you declare third parties the soul should be aware of — family, friends, coworkers, pets. Each entry becomes a named entity in the memory graph. When the soul extracts memories from conversation that mentions a declared relationship, she can attribute the memory to the right person rather than guessing.

You can add, edit, and soft-delete relationships. The section shows a warning when you exceed 20 entries.

### Letting the soul author her own self-model

The companion has a `narrative_self` — her evolving sense of who she is. The weekly consolidation pass rewrites it as her experience accumulates. You can also feed her a suggestion directly via the **Narrative Suggestion** input.

**For any of this to actually shape her turn, the SillyTavern character card description must be empty.** Identity gets resolved each turn in this order:

1. The ST character card description, if filled in → wins, every time
2. Otherwise: her stored `narrative_self` from `memu_self_model`
3. Otherwise: a generic default ("You are {name}…")

So if you write a character description in ST, that's who she is — her own self-model never reaches the prompt. Leave the description empty and she'll use what consolidation (and your suggestions) have built up.

**Using Narrative Suggestion**

1. Open the memU extension panel.
2. Type your suggestion in the **Narrative Suggestion** input — a phrasing, a correction, a new way of seeing herself.
3. Click **Send**. A green check ✓ means she accepted and integrated it; a red X ✗ means she chose not to.
4. If she accepts, the new text is written to her `narrative_self` and pushed back into the ST character description (so the panel stays in sync). The previous version is preserved in her memory store with an `evolved_into` link, so she can still recall what she used to think.
5. If you manually edit the ST character description yourself, **Send** disables with a warning — that's an "override" path; clear the manual edit to re-enable suggestions.

10-minute cooldown between suggestions so the soul isn't churning her identity every minute.

## Things to know

**One soul = one conversation.** Each `soul_id` is bound to a single conversation. If you want two parallel personalities (e.g., a partner *and* a separate research assistant), spin up two souls with two different `soul_id` values. They get isolated memory stores.

**Where the data lives.** All memory state is in a SQLite file at the path you set in `storage.metadata_store.dsn` (per soul, by default — check the path you wrote in `config.json`). To back up your companion, copy that file. To start fresh, delete it.

**This costs money to run.** Every turn calls your LLM provider (the soul's response). Every memorize calls it several more times (router + extraction per applicable type, plus optional category clustering). Consolidation calls it weekly, plus a per-episode background retrieval. APImw runs a couple of background calls after each turn. With a budget provider like NanoGPT this stays cheap, but it isn't free — assume real API spend.

**Consolidation cadence is real time, not turn count.** It's gated by `consolidation_interval_days` (default 7) since the last run. If you don't talk to her for two weeks then come back, the next memorize fires a consolidation immediately.

**Two background passes — don't confuse them.**
- **APImw** runs after each turn (multi-step retrieval + graph-edge writing). She comes back richer the next turn.
- **Consolidation** runs weekly (or on first activity after the interval lapses). She rewrites her self-model and writes diary entries.

## What's coming

**Additional procedural-memory domains** — the `mental_health` domain is live (see Mental Health Addon checkbox above). The architecture supports more curated knowledge bases. Next candidate: `tool-use` — how the soul has learned to use external tools, extracted from experience.

**PicoClaw** — an autonomous soul loop: the companion acts between conversations, pursuing her own intentions rather than sitting idle.

memU's design has been informed by reading [MemPalace](https://github.com/MemPalace/mempalace), another local-first AI memory project (MIT-licensed). They approach memory differently — verbatim storage rather than extraction — but share the local-first and temporal-graph commitments, and auditing our implementation against theirs sharpened parts of memU.
